# About the Data Analytics DevRoom

Data Analytics covers a wide range of activities involving data: Ingestion, Extraction, Stream Processing, Open Data
Formats, Data Storage, Scientific Libraries, OLAP Databases, Data Quality, Business Analytics, Data Visualization...

In recent years, we've seen a surge in trending Open Source projects like Apache Arrow, DuckDB, ClickHouse, Apache Druid,
QuestDB, Timescale, Grafana, Apache Superset, redash, matplotlib, seaborn, Bokeh, D3, graphic-walker, plots.jl, Makie,
Gadfly, ggplot2, Iceberg, Parquet, Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, LakeFS, Avro, ORC, Presto/Trino, OpenSearch, Valkey,
Apache Doris, Pinot, Debezium, Apache Pulsar, Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Vaex, scipy, numpy, Pandas, Polars, Dask,
Dagger.jl, Dataframes.jl, dplyr, tibble, tidyr, rsample, broom, tidyquant,  dbt, Apache Airflow, Dagster, DataHub,
Amundsen, Great Expectations, and many more.

This DevRoom is a celebration of Open Source Data Analytics projects of all types and sizes. We invite project
contributors to present their features, architecture, design, real-world use cases, and integrations. We also encourage
end users to share how open-source data analytics projects are helping them solve their everyday challenges.

The devroom is a colocated conference-within-a-conference that gives us the opportunity to come together and chat,
hack, and share stories about Data Analytics in FLOSS ecosystems.

This DevRoom is also an opportunity to identify potential collaborations across projects covering different aspects of
the data lifecycle.

We want our Devroom to be a safe space for everyone, so we kindly ask all participants to follow the FOSDEM code of
conduct https://fosdem.org/2025/practical/conduct/.

# Call For Papers


We welcome submissions about, but not limited to, open source libraries, open source projects, or technical use cases
explaining how one (or more) open source components are being used to power real-life use case. Talks featuring more
than one open source data project are encouraged. **All programming languages** are welcome.

If in doubt, think if the talk you want to submit would be appealing for an audience interested in data analytics. If
the answer is yes, please do submit.

We are aware some open source projects have also non-open source commercial offerings (we all need to pay the rent!).
This Devroom is only about the FOSS part of those projects, so please leave the commercial pitch outside of your
proposals and presentations.

## Diversity, junior developers, and first-time speakers

We actively encourage submissions from speakers from any backround and level of experience. We also welcome first-time
speakers and, if needed, we will be happy to help you rehearse your talk before the event.

## Format of the talks

We will be accepting submissions for 40-minute talks, for 10-minute lighthing talks, and for
5-minute project pitches. Please note if we don't get enough submissions, we might skip lightning talks and/or project pitches.

You choose the format of your talk. It can be shell-driven, slide-driven, demo-driven, or a combination. If you prefer,
you can also present without any screen at all, specifically for the lightning talks and project pitches.

If you will be accepting questions, please take into account those should be included within your allocated time-slot.

Since we will have a mixed audience, the 40-minute talks will need to feature an intro to make sure everyone can get some
context, but you are encouraged to discuss internals of your project or to go as deep as you want into technical details.

## Recording of all the talks

Please be aware of the fact that, barring any technical difficulties, Devroom talks at FOSDEM will be recorded. By
submitting a proposal you agree to being recorded and to have your talk made available.

# How to submit your talk

If you would like to submit a proposal, you need to do it via the official FOSDEM website at
[https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/analytics/](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/analytics/).
 **_When submitting your talk, make sure to select the ‘Data Analytics Devroom’ as the 'Track’._**. If you cannot see the type of talk (40 minutes, Lightning talk, OSS Project pitch) you want
 to submit on the dropdown, please just choose any value and leave a note mentioning the format of your session.


## Important dates

* Deadline: 2024-11-30 by midnight (Brussels Time)
* Announcement of selected talks: 2024-12-15
* Devroom will take place in Brussels, on Saturday February 1th 2025. If you have any special requests for a time slot in
case your talk is selected, please add the relevant information in the notes section of the CFP submission.

If you already know you want to submit a talk, please don't wait until the deadline, so we can dedicate more time to
review all the submissions.

## Your profile

Be sure to properly fill your profile with:
