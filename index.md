# About the Fast and Streaming Data DevRoom

10 years ago, working with Fast and Streaming data was very challenging and mostly limited to using Apache Spark or Apache Storm and the lambda architecture. Apache Kafka itself was not released until 2011. Since then, we have seen a huge evolution of the ecosystem, with whole families of products dedicated to working with fast and/or streaming data: Message Brokers, Stream  Processing Engines, Analytical Databases, Time-Series Databases, Real-Time Dashboards, Streaming ML Engines, or Streaming SQL Engines. 

Many of these tools have to face the same challenges: incomplete or out of order data, deduplication of events, ever-growing datasets, dealing with updates to already committed data, providing results in near-realtime, dealing with high availabity and upgrades when data is non-stop...

The devroom is a colocated conference-within-a-conference that gives us the opportunity to come together and chat, hack, and share stories about Fast and/or Streaming Data in FLOSS ecosystems.

The Fast and Streaming Data DevRoom is also an opportunity to identify potential collaborations across projects covering different aspects of the data lifecycle.

We want our Devroom to be a safe space for everyone, so we kindly ask all participants to follow the FOSDEM code of conduct https://fosdem.org/2023/practical/conduct/.

# Call For Papers


We welcome submissions about, but not limited to, open source libraries, open source projects, or technical use cases explaining how one (or more) open source components are being used to power a real-life use case. Talks featuring more than one open source fast/streaming data project are encouraged.

If in doubt, think if the talk you want to submit would be appealing for an audience interested in fast/streaming data. If the answer is yes, please do submit.

We are aware some open source projects have also non-open source commercial offerings. This Devroom is only about the FOSS part of those projects, so please leave the commercial pitch outside of your proposals and presentations.

## Diversity, junior developers, and first-time speakers

We actively encourage submissions from speakers from any backround and level of experience. We also welcome first-time speakers and, if needed, we will be happy to help you rehearse your talk before the event.

## Format of the talks

We will be accepting submissions for 30 minutes talks, and for 10 minutes lighthing talks. (If we don't get enough submissions, we might skip lightning talks)

You choose the format of your talk. It can be shell-driven, slide-driven, demo-driven, or a combination. If you prefer, you can also present without any screen at all, specifically for the lightning talks.

If you will be accepting questions, please take into account those should be included within your allocated time-slot.

Since we will have a mixed audience, all 30 minutes talks will need to feature an intro to make sure everyone can follow, but you are welcome to discuss internals of your project or to go as deep as you want into technical details.

## Recording of all the talks

Please be aware of the fact that, barring any technical difficulties, Devroom talks at FOSDEM will be recorded. By submitting a proposal you agree to being recorded and to have your talk made available.

# How to submit your talk

If you would like to submit a proposal, you need to do it via the official FOSDEM website at [https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/). If you already have a Pentabarf account from a previous FOSDEM edition, please reuse it.

## Important dates

* Deadline: 2022-11-30 by midnight (Brussels Time)
* Announcement of selected talks: 2022-12-15
* Devroom will take place in Brussels, from 10:30 to 14:30 on Saturday February 4th 2023.

If you already know you want to submit a talk, please don't wait until the deadline so we can dedicate more time to consider your submission.

## Your profile

Be sure to properly fill your Pentabarf profile (Person) with:
* your name
* a short speaker bio
* your contact information (for the organizers). Please do include both email and phone as there will be no other reliable form of emergency communication on the day.

Then follow Penta instructions to submit your talk (Create Event). 

## Your talk information

**_When submitting your talk, make sure to select the ‘Fast and Streaming Data Devroom’ as the 'Track’._**

Use the tabs on top of the Event page to provide all the information you think it is relevant. At the very least we would need:

* title and subtitle of the presentation
* short abstract
* duration of your talk. It needs to be either 30 minutes or 10 minutes
* if you have them (but no pressure otherwise), use the _Links_ section to link to other relevant details (other publications, video of previous talks, ...)
* use the _Submission Notes_ field to send any extra information
